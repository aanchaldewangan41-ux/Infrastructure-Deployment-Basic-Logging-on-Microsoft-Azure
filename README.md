# Infrastructure-Deployment-Basic-Logging-on-Microsoft-Azure
A real-world AWS cloud infrastructure and SOC lab demonstrating EC2 deployment, VPC networking, centralized logging, vulnerability testing and security remediation for cybersecurity learning and portfolio purposes.
# Azure Cloud Infrastructure & SOC Logging Lab

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a real-world enterprise-style cloud infrastructure on Microsoft Azure.  
The environment simulates a small company network where Linux-based virtual machines, centralized logging, vulnerability testing and security remediation are performed for cybersecurity learning and portfolio purposes.

The lab is intentionally configured with minimal security hardening to allow vulnerability identification, SOC analysis and remediation practices.

# Objectives

- Deploy Linux-based Azure Virtual Machines with defined enterprise roles  
- Design and configure Virtual Network, subnets and routing  
- Implement centralized logging using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics  
- Perform vulnerability scanning and attack simulation  
- Analyze logs for SOC operations  
- Apply security remediation and hardening  



# Infrastructure Design
- One Azure Virtual Network with public and private subnets  
- Network Security Groups (NSG) and Route Tables  
- Three Linux Virtual Machines  
  - Web Server  
  - Database Server  
  - Log Server  


# Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Azure  
- Azure Virtual Machines  
- Azure Virtual Network  
- Network Security Groups (NSG)  
- Azure Monitor & Log Analytics  
- Kali Linux  
- Nmap  
- Metasploit  
- Wireshark  

# Security Testing
- Port scanning  
- Vulnerability analysis  
- Password attack simulation  
- Network sniffing  
- Man-in-the-Middle testing  


# Remediation
- NSG firewall hardening  
- Patch management  
- Network segmentation  
- Secure IAM roles  
- Continuous log monitoring and alerting  

# Learning Outcome
Hands-on experience in cloud security, SOC operations, vulnerability assessment, attack simulation and remediation.
